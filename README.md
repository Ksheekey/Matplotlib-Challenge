# Matplotlib-Challenge

This one took me the longest yet and I think that will soon be a trend!

I got confused with some of the instructions on the page itself but tried my best to follow and produce the correct outputs. I hope most of my outputs are correct, if not I hope they at least show I understand the majority of what needs to be done even if my produced data wasnt perfect. And if it wasn't anywhere close to right.. i'm definitely one for constructive criticism. 

I re-did the matplot classes entirely over and over and joined study groups but still found a lot of it tough to grasp. It has been a LONG time since personally looking into statistics and coefficients so that was a rude awakening. I will continue to stuy but hopefully this hw admission is good!

my commits are lower this week, I spent all my time studying this week then tried to knock it out in a couple goes, and being it was demanding I was just into the work and forgot to periodically commit. I'll work on it!

Have a good weekend/week depening on when you read this.
